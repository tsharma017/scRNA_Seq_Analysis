Single-Cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) Downstream Analysis Steps

This guide outlines the key steps for analyzing scRNA-seq data, from raw counts to biological insights.

In my code: I used raw data from this nature journal:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25624-1

1. Data Loading & Quality Control
Load Data: Import the count matrix (e.g., from Cell Ranger, STARsolo, or Alevin) into an analysis tool (Seurat, Scanpy).

Quality Control:

Filter out low-quality cells (low gene counts, high mitochondrial reads).

Remove potential doublets and damaged cells.

2. Normalization & Feature Selection
Normalize Data: Adjust for sequencing depth differences (e.g., log normalization, SCTransform).

Select Highly Variable Genes (HVGs): Identify genes with high cell-to-cell variation for downstream analysis.

3. Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce dimensions to capture key variations.

Clustering: Group cells based on gene expression (e.g., Louvain, Leiden clustering).

Visualization:

UMAP/t-SNE: Project clusters into 2D/3D for exploration.

Marker Identification: Find genes defining each cluster (differential expression).

4. Cell Type Annotation
Automatic Annotation: Use reference databases (e.g., SingleR, Azimuth).

Manual Curation: Validate with known marker genes.

5. Advanced Analysis (Optional)
Trajectory Inference: Pseudotime analysis (Monocle3, PAGA).

Cell-Cell Communication: Predict interactions (CellChat, NicheNet).

Integration: Combine multiple datasets (Harmony, BBKNN).

6. Visualization & Reporting
Generate publication-ready plots (UMAP, violin plots, heatmaps).

Export results (cluster IDs, marker genes, DE tables).

Outputs
Processed count matrices.

Cluster labels & cell type annotations.

Differential expression results.

Interactive visualizations (HTML, R Shiny).

This pipeline ensures a structured approach from raw data to biological interpretation. Adjust parameters based on dataset size and research goals.
